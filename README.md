## 📖 About

This project is a comprehensive Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) curriculum designed to teach programming through game development. Each challenge progressively builds programming skills while leveraging mathematical and physics concepts, making it ideal for students with a strong foundation in STEM subjects.

### Key Features

- 🎯 **Progressive Learning**: 12 carefully designed challenges from basics to advanced
- 🔬 **Math & Physics Integration**: Every concept connects to real-world mathematics and physics
- 🎮 **Hands-On Projects**: Learn by building interactive games and simulations
- 📚 **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed explanations, reflection questions, and experiment ideas
- 🚀 **Fast-Paced**: Designed for motivated students who can handle complexity

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pygame-cbl-project.git
   cd pygame-cbl-project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run your first challenge**
   ```bash
   python challenges/challenge_1_1_moving_circle.py
   ```

## 📚 Learning Path

The curriculum is divided into 4 phases over 8 weeks:

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-2)
- Challenge 1.1: Moving Circle - Coordinates and basic movement
- Challenge 1.2: Bouncing Ball - Physics and conditionals
- Challenge 1.3: Gravity Simulator - Acceleration and time-based movement

### Phase 2: Interactive Games (Weeks 3-4)
- Challenge 2.1: Catch the Falling Numbers
- Challenge 2.2: Projectile Motion Game
- Challenge 2.3: Vector Field Visualization

### Phase 3: Advanced Mechanics (Weeks 5-6)
- Challenge 3.1: Pendulum Simulator
- Challenge 3.2: Orbit Simulator
- Challenge 3.3: Wave Interference

### Phase 4: Capstone Projects (Weeks 7-8)
- Challenge 4.1: Physics Puzzle Game
- Challenge 4.2: Math Racing Game

See [`CBL_LEARNING_PLAN.md`](CBL_LEARNING_PLAN.md) for the complete detailed roadmap.

## 🎯 Getting Started

1. **Read the Learning Plan**: Start with `CBL_LEARNING_PLAN.md` to understand the full curriculum
2. **Begin with Challenge 1.1**: Run `challenges/challenge_1_1_moving_circle.py`
3. **Experiment**: Modify the code, change values, see what happens!
4. **Reflect**: Answer the reflection questions in each challenge
5. **Progress**: Move to the next challenge when ready

## 💡 Learning Tips

- **Experiment Freely**: Change values, break things, fix them - that's how you learn!
- **Connect Concepts**: Relate every programming concept to math/physics you know
- **Read Comments**: Each file has detailed explanations
- **Try Experiments**: Each challenge includes "Experiment Ideas" to extend your learning
- **Have Fun**: Learning programming should be enjoyable! 🎮

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: Modern Python features
- **Pygame 2.5+**: Game development framework
- **NumPy**: Mathematical operations (for advanced challenges)

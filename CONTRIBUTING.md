2. Create a new issue with a clear title and description
3. Include steps to reproduce (for bugs)
4. Add labels if applicable

### Suggesting New Challenges

We welcome new challenge ideas! When suggesting:
- Describe the math/physics concepts involved
- Explain the programming concepts it teaches
- Provide a rough implementation idea
- Consider the difficulty level and where it fits in the progression

### Code Contributions

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
   - Add comments explaining concepts
   - Include reflection questions and experiment ideas
   - Test your code
4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: Description of your changes"
   ```
5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Provide a clear description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Explain what the change adds/improves

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Include inline comments explaining math/physics concepts
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guide

## Challenge Structure

When creating a new challenge, include:

1. **Header comment** with:
   - Challenge name and number
   - Math/physics concepts
   - Programming concepts
   - Learning outcomes

2. **Well-commented code** explaining:
   - What each section does
   - Why certain approaches are used
   - Connections to math/physics

3. **Reflection questions** at the end

4. **Experiment ideas** for students to extend learning

## Testing

Before submitting:
- Run the challenge to ensure it works
- Test on Python 3.8+
- Verify all dependencies are in requirements.txt
- Check that comments are clear and helpful

# 🎮 Challenge Files

This directory contains all the challenge projects for the CBL learning program.

## How to Run

Each challenge is a standalone Python file. To run a challenge:

```bash
python3 challenges/challenge_1_1_moving_circle.py
```

## Challenge Structure

### Phase 1: Foundations
- **Challenge 1.1**: `challenge_1_1_moving_circle.py` - Basic movement
- **Challenge 1.2**: `challenge_1_2_bouncing_ball.py` - Physics and bouncing
- **Challenge 1.3**: `challenge_1_3_gravity_simulator.py` - Gravity simulation

### Phase 2: Interactive Games
- Coming soon!

### Phase 3: Advanced Mechanics
- Coming soon!

### Phase 4: Capstone Projects
- Coming soon!

## Tips for Learning

1. **Run the code first** - See what it does
2. **Read the comments** - They explain what's happening
3. **Experiment** - Change values and see what happens
4. **Answer reflection questions** - Think about what you learned
5. **Try the experiment ideas** - Extend the code yourself!

## Getting Help

- Check the main `CBL_LEARNING_PLAN.md` for the learning roadmap
- Each file has detailed comments explaining concepts
- Try modifying one thing at a time to understand it better
